Arduino C++ library for interfacing an Arduino through NewSoftSerial to the iRobot Create/Roomba Open Interface API.  The hardware serial ports are used for feedback to the Arduino Serial Monitor, improving testing capabilities.
The API may also work with Arduino Mega, though that USART interface is not as well tested.
The API is implemented using Eclipse C++, and can be used as a platform/template for other Arduino projects.  (includes Arduino Core 0022)
